enterprize application(business application)(banking,ecomers,health care,sports(starsports) applications are come under business applications) .

to bulid EPA mvc 2 is recommended.

**as a view  we can use HTML,HTML5,JSP,CustomTags///,css,css3,jquery(to provide styles)
(for providing validations)javaScript,jquery,nodejs,angularjs,bootstrap(javascript frameworks).***


****controler need to have capability to read the data which is coming from presentation part and finally it need  to send  output.****

*we can use servlets ,jsp,filter,tag support()*

***
model :-

1)DAO (data base crud opertaions)

JDBC(it is not ORM),HIBERNATE,IBatics,Many ORM Tools,EJB.

JDBC  disadvantage
