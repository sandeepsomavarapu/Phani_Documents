HIBERNATE(ORM TOOL):-(Gavin king)
======================


meaning:sleep mode

MVC(model view controller)

 =>Here hibernate helps under model part.
presentation          controller                 model


model again devide into three parts.(Service(extra services like security ,mailing ,transaction,login,jms,jnds,loger these required for business), Business(for business code),DAO(for data access))



DAO (Data Access object)Part .

 To interact with database we have jdbc DAO ,but why should go for ORM(OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING).

IN JDBC we dont have support like cache,and ejb(orm tool )it will provide cache support
In jdbc we need to write database dependent query like sql,mysql....ec  where as ORM tools we no need to write

database dependent query ,we just write Query language
 internally it converts database query here we no need to learn different query languages like sql and plsql.... etc


Ex: today we are working with ORACLE  may be tomarrow we need to work with MYSQL so we no need to bather about ,internally it converts MYSQL querys . 

EJB entity beans main disadvantage is it needs to depend n session bean if we required or not required.





==>with out application servers we cant work with EJB (web logic, jboss,glassfish).

==>these are used to provide services like (transaction,mailing, jms....etc).

********************************************************
===>hibernate will provide exception free we will not get any compile time errors,we will get only run time exceptions,and it provides hql for any data base to interact,and iit provides Cache support.

**
1)Auto DDl:-
-----------------------
*generally in jdbc if we want insert data into a table first we need create table before gng to run the application then we need  to run the application then the data will be inserted.

here in hibernate we no need to create tables based n requirement automaticaly created the tables  when ever we run the application.(ORM)

2)HQl support

3)Cache support

4)PK generaters(id 's are bydefault generated by hibernate).

5)validations support(data validation(by using annotations))****

6)exception free

7)ORM support(is-a,has-a)by ORM we can maintain object to object relation .(sql/RDBMS)

8)OGM(object graph mapping) support(non sql)

9)hibernate search

last two are in hibernate 4 version

10)annoations support



OBJECT TYPES:-
--------------------------------

**in hibernate if want  perform update ,delete,savewe need to pass objects.


therre are three types of objects 


1)transiant object
2)persistence object 
3)detached object




 




Auto key genaraters:-
---------------------------------

**it will genearate primary keys automatically.


1)assigned(dafault) //here use is responcible to pass id's 
2)increment              //automatically it will create id and next it will increments.
3)sequence
4)identity
5)nature
6)foreign
7)custom
8)hilo

1)
<id name="id" class="id">
<genearater class="assigned"/>(weather we are using are not  it will use generater class as assigned)
</id>

<id name="id" class="id">
<genearater class="increment"/>(it will take maximum id from the table then id++.... )
</id>


identity :-
=========

*in case identity DB is responcible to increment the id's.

*tt is responcible for increment the PK at data base level oracle is not support this but DB2,MYSQL will support this identity.(we can increment PK).

sequence:-
------------------
in case of sequence database and applicaion layers are responcible
