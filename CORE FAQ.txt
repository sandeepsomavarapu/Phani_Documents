What is classloader ?
Class loader subsystem will load the .class file into java stack and later sufficient
memory will be allocated for all the properties of the java program into following five
memory locations.
 Heap area
 Method area
 Java stack
 PC register
 Native stack

What is Main aim of JIT Compiler ?
The main aim of JIT compiler is to speed up the execution of java program.


Constructor:
===========
Why use constructor ?
The main purpose of create a constructor is, for placing user defined values in place of
default values.

Why constructor not return any value ?
Constructor will never return any value even void, because the basic aim constructor
is to place value in the object

What is Wrapper Classes ?
For each and every fundamental data type there exist a pre-defined class, Such
predefined class is known as wrapper class.



Which access specifier are called universal access specifier ?

Public

Which access specifier is not a keyword ?
Default

Which access specifier is package level access specifier ?
Default



Scope of protected specifier ?
protected members of class is accessible within the same class and other class of same
package and also accessible in inherited class of other package.

Scope of private access specifier ?

private members of class in not accessible any where in program these are only
accessible within the class. private are also called class level access specifier.





String class:
===========
1)The data which enclosed within double                                                              
quote (" ") is by default treated as String
class.

2) String class object is immutable 

3)When we create an object of String class
by default no additional character
memory space is created.


String Buffer:-
============

1)The data which enclosed within double
quote (" ") is not by default treated as
StringBuffer class

2)StringBuffer class object is mutable


3)When we create an object of StringBuffer
class by default we get 16 additional
character memory space.



Note:-
=====
== Operator is always used for comparing references of both source and destination
objects but not their contents



When we use String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder
============================================
 If the content is fixed and would not change frequently then we use String.
 If content is not fixed and keep on changing but thread safety is required then we use
StringBuffer
 If content is not fixed and keep on changing and thread safety is not required then we
use StringBuilder


Note:-
========
All the things between StringBuffer and StringBuilder are same only difference is
StringBuffer is synchronized and StringBuilder is not synchronized



What is StringTokenizer ?
It is a pre defined class in java.util package can be used to split the given string into
tokens (parts) based on delimiters (any special symbols or spaces).



What is Exception Handling ?
The process of converting system error messages into user friendly error message is
known as Exception handling.


What is Exception ?
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that
disrupts the normal flow of the program's Instructions.



Difference between Error and Exception

Error:
=====
Can be handle.

Example:
--------------
NoSuchMethodError
OutOfMemoryError

Exception:
=========
Can not be handle.

Example:
--------------
ClassNotFoundException
NumberFormateException
Can any try block contain another try block ?
Yes, One try block can contains another try block that is nested or inner try block can
be possible.



When IOException is thrown ?
IOException is thrown in following conditions which is given below;
 Try to transfer more data but less data are present.
 Try to read data which is corrupted
 Try to write but file is read only.

When ArithmeticException is thrown ?
The ArithmeticException is thrown when integer is divided by zero or taking the
remainder of a number by zero. It is never thrown in floating-point operations.


Difference between throw and throws ?

throw 
----------
1)throw is a keyword used for hitting
and generating the exception which
are occurring as a part of method body


2)The place of using throw keyword is
always as a part of method body.



throws
-------------


1)throws is a keyword which gives an indication
to the specific method to place the common
exception methods as a part of try and catch
block for generating user friendly error
messages

2)The place of using throws is a keyword is
always as a part of method heading





Checked Exception:
=====================
checked Exception are checked at compile time

e.g.
IOException, SQLException,
FileNotFoundException etc.


Un-Checked Exception:-
=====================
un-checked Exception are checked at run time

e.g.
ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
NumberNotFoundException etc.







What is thread ?

**Thread is a lightweight components and it is a flow of control. In other words a flow of
control is known as thread.

What is multithreading ?
**Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.




State of a thread are classified into five types they are
 New State
 Ready State
 Running State
 Waiting State
 Halted or dead State





How to achieve multithreading in java ?
In java language multithreading can be achieve in two different ways.
 Using thread class
 Using Runnable interface




In which state no memory is available for thread ?
If the thread is in new or dead state no memory is available but sufficient memory is
available if that is in ready or running or waiting state


Difference between sleep() and suspend() ?

Sleep() can be used to convert running state to waiting state and automatically thread
======
convert from waiting state to running state once the given time period is completed.


suspend() can be used to convert running state thread to waiting state but it
=========
will never return back to running state automatically.



What is Thread Synchronization ?
Allowing only one thread at a time to utilized the same resource out of multiple
threads is known as thread synchronization or thread safe.




Why use Thread Synchronization ?
Whenever multiple threads are trying to use same resource than they may be chance
to of getting wrong output, to overcome this problem thread synchronization can be
used.




How to achieve Thread Synchronization in java ?
In java language thread synchronization can be achieve in two different ways.
 Synchronized block
 Synchronized method







 this keyword:-
===============
The main purpose of using this keyword is to differenciate the formal parameter and
data members of class, whenever the formal parameter and data members of the class
are similar then jvm get ambiguty (no clearity between formal parameter and member
of the class)

To differenciate between formal parameter and data member of the class, the data
member of the class must be preceded by "this".

When Need of super keyword ?

Whenever the derived class is inherits the base class features, there is a possibility
that base class features are similar to derived class features and JVM gets an
ambiguity. 

In order to differentiate between base class features and derived class
features must be preceded by super keyword.



What is the difference between this. (this dot) and this() (this off).

**this. can be used to differentiate variable of class and formal parameters of method or
constructor.

**this() can be used to call one constructor within the another constructor without
creation of objects multiple time for the same class.




what is difference between super and this keyword
Super class is always pointing to base/super/parent class features and this keyword is always
pointing to current class features.

What is difference between super(), super(..), this() and this(..).

===>super() and super(..) are used for establishing the communication between base class
         and derived class constructor.

===>this() and this(...) are used for establishing the communication between current class
constructor.


Why abstract class not made as final ?
Abstract classes definitions should not be made as final because abstract classes
always participate in inheritance classes.




**Main advantage of Synchronized keyword ?
The main advantage of Synchronized keyword is we can resolve data inconsistency
problem.

**The main dis-advantage of Synchronized keyword ?
The main dis-advantage of Synchronized keyword is it increased the waiting time of
thread and effect performance of the system, Hence if there is no specific requirement
it is never recommended to use synchronized keyword.



What is Inheritance ?
The process of obtaining the data members and methods from one class to another
class is known as inheritance. It is one of the fundamental features of object-oriented
programming.




How many type of inheritance are allow in java ?
In Java following inheritance are allow;
 Single inheritance
 Multilevel inheritance
 Hierarchical inheritance
 Hybrid inheritance





What is interface ?
Interface is similar to class which is collection of public static final variables
(constants) and abstract methods.

Why use interface in java ?
In java interface are used for achieve multiple inheriatance.

Can an Interface extend another Interface?
Yes an Interface can inherit another Interface.

How interface is similar to class ?
Whenever we compile any Interface program it generate .class file. That means the

bytecode of an interface appears in a .class file.

Interface:-
===========
we cannot instantiate an interface.
 An interface does not contain any constructors.
 All methods in an interface are abstract.
 An interface cannot contain instance fields. Interface only contains public static final
variables.
 An interface is can not extended by a class; it is implemented by a class.
 An interface can extend multiple interfaces. That means interface support multiple
inheritance

Difference between abstract class and concrete class ?


Difference between Abstract and Interface ?


Difference between Overloading and Overriding ?



collections:-
===========
java.util.*;
java.io.*;
java.




What is the benefit of Generics in Collections Framework?


What is different between Iterator and ListIterator?

Comprable:-
===========
Comparable interface is used to provide the natural sorting of objects and we can use it to provide sorting based on single logic.

Comparator :-
=============
interface is used to provide different algorithms for sorting and we can chose the comparator we want to use to sort the given collection of objects.




1) Can abstract class have constructors in Java?
Yes, an abstract class can declare and define a constructor in Java. Since you can not create an instance of an abstract class, a constructor can only be called during constructor chaining, i.e. when you create an instance of the concrete implementation class. 

Now some interviewer, ask what is the purpose of a constructor, if you can not instantiate abstract class? Well, it can still be used to initialize common variables, which are declared inside an abstract class, and used by the various implementation. 

Also even if you don뭪 provide any constructor, the compiler will add default no-argument constructor in an abstract class, without that your subclass will not compile, since the first statement in any constructor implicitly calls super(), default superclass constructor in Java.



2) Can abstract class implements interface in Java? do they require to implement all methods?

 
Yes, an abstract class can implement an interface by using the implements keyword. Since they are abstract, they don뭪 need to implement all methods. It뭩 good practice to provide an abstract base class, along with an interface to declare Type. One example of this is java.util.List interface and corresponding java.util.AbstractList abstract class. 

Since AbstractList implements all common methods,  concrete implementations like LinkedList and ArrayList are free from the burden of implementing all methods, had they implemented List interface directly. 

It뭩 best of both worlds, you can get the advantage of interface for declaring type, and flexibility of abstract class to implement common behavior in one place. Effective Java has a nice chapter on how to use interface and abstract class in Java, which is worth reading.




3) Can an abstract class be final in Java?
No, an abstract class can not be final in Java. Making them final will stop the abstract class from being extended, which is the only way to use an abstract class. They are also opposite of each other, abstract keyword enforces to extend a class, for using it, on the other hand, final keyword prevents a class from being extended. In real world also, abstract signifies incompleteness, while final is used to demonstrate completeness. Bottom line is, you can not make your class abstract and final in Java, at same time, it뭩 a compile time error.



4) Can abstract class have static methods in Java?
Yes, an abstract class can declare and define static methods, nothing prevents from doing that. But, you must follow guidelines for making a method static in Java, as it뭩 not welcomed in a object oriented design, because static methods can not be overridden in Java. It뭩 very rare, you see static methods inside abstract class, but as I said, if you have very good reason of doing it, then nothing stops you.



5) Can you create an instance of abstract class?
No, you can not create instance of abstract class in Java, they are incomplete. Even though, if your abstract class don뭪 contain any abstract method, you can not create instance of it. By making a class abstract,  you told compiler that, it뭩 incomplete and should not be instantiated. Java compiler will throw error, when a code tries to instantiate abstract class.



6) Is it necessary for an abstract class to have an abstract method?

 
No, It뭩 not mandatory for an abstract class to have any abstract method. You can make a class abstract in Java, by just using abstract keyword in class declaration. Compiler will enforce all structural restriction, applied to abstract class, e.g. now allowing to create any instance. By the way, it뭩 debatable whether you should have abstract method inside abstract class or interface. In my opinion, abstract class should have abstract methods, because that뭩 the first thing programmer assumes, when he see that class. That would also go nicely along principle of least surprise.



7) Difference between abstract class and interface in Java?
This is the most important and one of the classic Java Interview question. I don뭪 know, how many times I have seen this question at all most all levels of Java interviews. One reason, which makes this question interesting is the ability to produce example. It뭩 easy to answers questions on core OOPS concepts like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance, but when it comes to subtle points like this, candidate more often fumbled. You can see this post for all syntactical difference between abstract class and interface, but it deserve a post on it뭩 own.



8) When do you favor abstract class over interface?
This is the follow-up of previous interview questions on abstract class and interface. If you know syntactical difference, you can answer this question quite easily, as they are the one, which drives the decision. Since it뭩 almost impossible to add a new method on a published interface, it뭩 better to use abstract class, when evolution is concern. Abstract class in Java evolves better than interface. Similarly, if you have too many methods inside interface, you are creating pain for all it뭩 implementation, consider providing an abstract class for default implementation. This is the pattern followed in Java collection package, you can see AbstractList provides default implementation for List interface.



9) What is abstract method in Java?
An abstract method is a method without body. You just declare method, without defining it and use abstract keyword in method declaration.  All method declared inside Java Interface are by default abstract. Here is an example of abstract method in Java

                public void abstract printVersion();

Now, In order to implement this method, you need to extend abstract class and override this method.



10) Can abstract class contains main method in Java ?
Yes, abstract class can contain main method, it just another static method and you can execute Abstract class with main method, until you don뭪 create any instance.
