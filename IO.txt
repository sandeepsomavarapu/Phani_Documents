Byte Stream : It provides a convenient means for handling input and output of byte.
Character Stream : It provides a convenient means for handling input and output of characters. Character stream uses Unicode and therefore can be internationalized.

InputStream:-
===========

**InputStream is a abstract class present   in java.io.* package  and which implements Closeable interface present in java.io.* package

**java.io.Closeable is the  interface  which containse one method  called close() and Closeable interface internally extends java.lang.AutoCloseable which containse one method  called close().

**this is the super class for all classes representing an inputstream of bytes.

child classes:
============

AudioInputStream,ByteArrayInputStream,FileInputStream,FilterInputStream,InputStream,ObjectInputStream,PipedInputStream,SequenceInputStream,StringBufferInputStream

it has only one constructor  i.e====>InputStream().

OutputStream:-
=============

**OutputStream is the abstract class  whcich implements        java.io.Closeable  ,    java.io.Flushable


** java.io.Flushable  interface which containse only one abstract  method callled flush().


**ByteArrayOutputStream

**FileOutputStream

**FilterOutputStream

**ObjectOutputStream

**PipedOutputStream


Constructor=====> OutputStream()




GarbageCollecter:-
================

***GC is an apllication program which runs inside the JVM. 


**Functionality:
===============
**it collects the unused memory.

**it will check heap  memory those objects which are unreferenced it will collect.

**it follows mark and sweep  algorithm
