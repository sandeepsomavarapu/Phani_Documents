1. Overloading of the main method is possible but JVM will always call String[] argument main method only.

2. The other overload method we have to call explicitly then it will be executed just a normal method call.


 
         class Test

	{

          public static void main (String [] args)

		{

			System.out.println("String []");

		}

	  public static void main (int [] args)

		{

			System.out.println("int []");
	
		}
	}


3. Inheritance concept applicable for the main method. Hence while executing child class if child class doesn't contain 
   main then parent class main method will be executed.


	class p
	{

	  public static void main (String [] args)

		{
			System.out.println("parent main");
		}
	}
	class c extends p
	{
	
	}	

      java p
o/p : parent main

      java c
o/p : parent main


4. For main method inhertance and overloading concepts are applicable but overriding concept in not applicable instead of overriding method hidding is applicable.
