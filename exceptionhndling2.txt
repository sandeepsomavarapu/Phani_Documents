Exception
=========

error:-
=====



Default ExceptionHandling:-
=========================
in a program atleast method terrminates abnormally then the program terrmination is abnormal termination

*if all methods terminated normally then only program termination is normal termination.

Exception hirarchy:-
--------------------

Object Class  java.lang.*;.....default package 

Object class is super class for all the java  classes and interfaces 

   *Throwable class acts as route for java exception hirarchy

it defines two child  classes 

  1)Exception
 
  2)Error

1)Exception:-
=============
int a=10;
int b=sakd;
sop(dont enter zero as denminator)

int  c=a/0;Arthimetic Exception
sop(c);//2

*most of the times Exceptions are caused by our program and these are recoverable 

*if our program requirement is read data from remote file located at london at run time the remote file not available ,then we will get runtime exception saying 
FileNotFound Exception ,if this exception occurs we can provide local file and continue rest of the program normally.


try{
read the data from remote file located at  london ,at run time
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e)
{
use localfile and continue rest of the program normally
}


Error:-
-------

*Most of the time errors are not caused by our program and these are due to lack of system resourses,and these are non recoverable.

**for example if OutOfMemory error occurs being a programer we cant do any thing and program will be terminated abnormally 
and system admin server admin is responsible to increase heap memory .

Cheked and Unchecked Exception:-
===============================

     Cheked Exception:-
     -----------------
 *** The exceptions which are cheked by compiler for smooth execution of the program are called checked exceptions

Ex:-FileNotFoundException
====
*in our program if there is a chance of rising cheked exception then compusary we should handle that 
checked exception either by try catch or by throws keyword otherwise we will get comile time error


import java.io.*;

class test
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
PrintWriter pe=new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
pw.println("hello");
}
}

output:-"error"

UnChekedException:-
===================

*the exceptions which are not checked by compiler weather the programer handling or not such type exceptions are called unchecked exceptions 

Example:-ArthimeticException...


import java.io.*;

class test
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
PrintWriter pe=new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
pw.println("hello");
sopln(10/0);
}
}


Note:-weather it is checked or unchecked every exception occurs at run time only,there isno chnace occuring at compile time

*RUNTIME exceptions and childclasses error and child classes are unchecked except these remaining are checked /


fully checked vs partially checked:-
-----------------------------------


a checked exception is said to be fully checked if and only if  all its child classes also checked 

Ex:-
IoException
InterptedException
a checked exception is said to be paritally checked if and only if some ofits child classes are  not  checked

Ex:-
Exception
Throwable

Thread.sleep();
