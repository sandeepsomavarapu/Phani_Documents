INTERFACE
=========

1. if we don't know anything about implementation just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface.
 
 ex. servlet

ABSTRACT CLASS
==============

2. if we talking about implementation but not completely (partial implementation) then we should go for Abstarct class.
 
 ex. Generic servlet & Http servlet

CONCRETE CLASS
===============

3. if we talking about implementation completely and ready to provide service then we should go for concrete class.
 
 ex.MyOwnServlet
