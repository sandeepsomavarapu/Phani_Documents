main intraduction:-
-----------------------
* wheather class contains main() method or not and whether main() method is declared according to requirement     or not these things won't be checked by compiler.at runtime,jvm is responsible to check these things.
* at run time if jvm is unable to find required main() method then we will get runtime exception saying  
  nosuchmethod error.main
class test
{

}
javac test.java;(compilation success)
java test;(run time exception)


{ Error: Main method not found in class main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application }

                               -----------------------------------------
                              |PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN |
                              ------------------------------------------

PUBLIC---->TO CALL BY JVM FROM ANYWHERE

STATIC---->WITHOUT EXSISTING OBJECT ALSO JVM HAS TO CALL THIS METHOD NO WAY RELATED TO ANY OBJECT

VOID()---->MAIN() METHOD WONT RETURN ANYTHING TO JVM

MAIN---->THIS IS NAME WHICH IS CONFIGURED INSIDE JVM

STRING[]ARGS--->COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

* The above syntax is very strict if we perform any change we will get runtime exception saying NOSUCHMETHOD ERROR.MAIN.

even though the above syntax is very strict the following changes are acceptable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*the order of modifiers i not important that is instead of "public static "we can take "static public also.

*we can declare "strign[]"in any acceeptable form.
main(String[] args)

main(String []args)

main(String args[])

*instead of 'args' we can take any valid java identifier
*we can replace String[] with var arg parameter
main(String [] args)==>main(String...args)
* we can declare main() method with th e following modifiers also.
      ..final
      ..synchronized
      ..strictfp 


CASE1:-
------------
*overloading of the main method  is possible but jvm will always call String[] argumentmain method only.

*the other overloaded method method we have to call explicity then it will be executed just a normal mthod call.

                        class test
                          {
                            public static void main(String args[])
                             } 
                           System.out.println("Strign[]");
                            }
                public static void main(int args[])
                 {
                    System.out.println("int[]");
                    }
}

case2:-
--------
class p
{
public static void main(String [] args)
{
System.out.println("parent main");
}
class c extends p
{

}
}
case3:-
---------
it seems overriding concept applicable for main method but it is not overriding is it method hiding.


class p
{
public static void main(String [] args)
{
System.out.println("parent main");
}
}
class c extends p
{
public static void main(String [] args)
{
System.out.println("child main");
}
}
note:-
======
*for main method inheritance and overloading concepts are applicable but overriding concept is not applicable instead of overriding method hiding concept is applicable
