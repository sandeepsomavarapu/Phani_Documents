yield:
======
yield method is used to pause current executing thread to give the chance for waiting threads of same priority.
if there is no waiting thread or all waiting threads have low priority then same thread can continue it's execution.

Note: if multiple threads are waiting with same priority then which thread wil get the chance?

we cant expect why because it depends on thread schedular.

join:
======
t1

t2

t3

t1.join()

after complition/termination of t1 thread will get the chance to t2,t3
sleep:
======
t1.sleep()

thread execution stop for some time.


t1.setPriority(Norm_priority);===t1.setpriority(1);
