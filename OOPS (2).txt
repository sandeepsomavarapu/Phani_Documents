OOPS:-
==============                                         
*the programing methodology where everything represented as an object is known as truly oops.(smaltalk)
*oops is methodology to design a program using classes and objects.
(class, object ,inheritance)

object:-
object is a real world entity,entity that has state and behaviour.physical.
class :-
class is collection of objects and data members,it is logical entity

1)DATA HIDING:-
==============
Hiding of data
==>out side person can't access our internal data directly OR our internal data sholud not go out directly 
this oop feature is nothing but data hiding.
=>after validation out side person can access our internal data.
ex:-after providing proper U.N and PWD we can able to access our gmail inbox information.
ex:-even though we r valid customer of bank we can able access our account  information and we can't access other acnt information.  


**By declaring  data member (variable)as private we can achieve data hiding  
ex:-
p class account
{
private double balance; 
/*when i make balance as private,no outer class can't access if want to access then call method then valdation success we will get.otherwise not.
}
p double get balance()
{
validation;
return balance;
}                  
*the main advantage of data hiding is 'security'.
*it is highly recomended to declare data member(variable) as private.

2)ABSTRATION :-
=============
Hiding internal implmentation and just highlight the set  of services what we r offering is the concept of abstraction
ex:-through bank ATM gui screen bank people are highlighting the set of services what they are offeringwith out hilighting internal implementation.
 		
the main advantages abstraction are 
1)we can achieve security because we are not highlighting our internal implementation 
2)with effecting out side person we can able to perform any type of changes in our internal system and hence enhancement will become easy
3) it improves maintain ability of the application.
4)it improves easyness to use our system.

**By using interfaces and abstract classes we can implement abstraction .

ENCAPSULATION:-
==================
THE PROCESS OF BINDING DATA AND  corresponding methods into a single unit is nothing but encapsulation 
ex:
class student
{
data members
           +
methods(behaviour)
}

***technical
****if any component follows data hiding and abstraction such type of component is said to be encapsulated component
encapsulation =data hiding +abstraction;
ex:-
public class account
{
public double balance;

pblic double get balance()
{
//validation
return balance
}
public void setbalance(double balance)
{
//validation
this.balance=balance;
}
}
the main advantages of encapsulation are 
1)we can achieve security
2)enhancement will become easy
3)it improves maintainbility of the application 
the main aadvantage of encapsulation is we can achieve security  but the main dis-advantage of encapsulation is it increases length of the code and slows down execution .
TIGHTLY ENCAPSULATION:-
=========================
a class is said to be tightly encapsulated if and only if each and every variable declared as private.
weather class contain corresponding getter and sender meathods are not and weather these meathods are declared as public or not these things we are not required check
Ex:-
public class account
{
private double balance;
public double getbalance()
{
return balance;
}
}
1)which of the following classes are tightly encapsulated ?
class a
{
private int x=10;
}
class b extends a 
{
float y=2.5;
}
class c extends a
{
private int z=12;
}
ans:class A and class c are tightly encapsulated

2)which of the following classes are tightly encapsulated ?

class A
{
int x=11;
}
class B extends A
{
private int y=21;
}
class C extends B
{
private int z=22;
}
ANS:-if the parent class not tightly encapsulated then no child class is tightly encapsulated.
